Project: Format String Vulnerability:
-------Program 1--------
/*
Ran this program on x86_64 bit ubuntu machine with 14.04 LTS version.
compile this program with 

gcc -w program1.c -o program1

run the program as follows:

./program1
Inserting into memory a value: ?????
Inserted value is:30


Here we can see that a particular value is being inserted at  a particular address:
using this info it is possible to provide a particular value at that address like a shellcode varibale address .


When I run this program using 

LD_PRELOAD=./finalprintf.so ./program1

the output is :

./program1
Inserting into memory a value: ?????
Inserted value is:0

So no value is inserted here.

-------Program 2--------


Ran this program on x86_64 bit ubuntu machine with 14.04 LTS version.
compile this program with 

gcc -w program2.c -o program2

run the program as follows:

./program2

Output:

Segmenatation Fault(Core Dumped):

when I run the program with my printf function there is no seg fault

LD_PRELOAD=./finalprintf.so ./program2



-------Program 3--------


Ran this program on x86_64 bit ubuntu machine with 14.04 LTS version.
compile this program with 

gcc -w program3.c -o program3

run the program as follows:

./program3 CCCC%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x
correct:
CCCC%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x
Incorrect:
CCCCf7ff5000.f7dd59e0.f7b00870.f7dd59e0
value  @ address :0x00601058 = 10 [0x0000000a]

Here we can see in incorrect way of printf we know a value stored at a particular addresss :
using this info it is possible to overwrite that address with a value of attacker's choosing.

Like with %n modifier,
